This project uses the super-fast bundler, [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io).

## Available Scripts

```sh
npm run build
```

This command builds the extension from the source and assets.

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command starts esbuild in watch mode. Whenever a file change is detected, esbuild rebuilds the extension.
